It is a Bulk Email Sender script specifically designed for my friend's need.
In this script we are sending bulk emails to students of different university seeking information
regarding the admission prospectus of that year.

This scrip can be Modified accordingly for any one use:
1) Add your email credential details in auth.py file from which you want to send email.
2) Remember only gmail is supported and you cannot send more than 1500 emails per day.
3) Enable access to less secure apps in gmail settings. (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)
4) Modify sender, from_add, subj, message_text variable in the main script.
